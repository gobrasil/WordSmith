            <h3>WordSmith is Changing.</h3>
            The framework will no longer be shipped with each individual package, instead there will be a framework plugin released shortly which contains the necessary libraries.<br/><br/>
            Changes will be made frequently as required, hopefully soon i'll be able to dedicate more time to maintaining this project.<br/>
            If you would like to contribute to this project please get in touch with me via GitHub.
