# WordSmith
WordSmith is both a framework and a theme boilerplate for WordPress developers.
Coupled with composer, bower and grunt the boilerplate is an excellent place to start when developing a WordPress theme.

For the beginner developer the boilerplate is an introduction to modern PHP standards and Object Oriented Design,
by enforcing encapsulated classes within a strict application structure beginner developers get a crash course in how modern PHP applications should look both inside and out.

For the more advanced developer the application structure allows for a greater integration of the wider PHP world into the WordPress CMS environment. the application structre allows for existing and customized composer packages to be available to your application logic in the most convenient possible way when you need it the most. gone are the days of manually managing WordPress PHP dependencies.
