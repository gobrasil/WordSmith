# WordSmith
WordSmith is a standards compliant WordPress theme & plugin framework which allows developers the ability to forge their own effective and dynamic WordPress sites. The framework is designed to be useable for new & experienced developers alike, with strong OOP design and a name spaced library of smart helper classes, WordSmith gives WordPress a helping hand into the world of dynamic php development. WordPress itself is a great system that almost every user in the world can learn but for developers there are features intentionally left out of the CMS which would allow it to become so much more than just a great tool for managing content.
